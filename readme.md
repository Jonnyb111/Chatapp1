# Chat bot configuration soon to add docker details once i figure out a few more things.
# Configure
# you will need to create a env, install the requirements and then you can launch it 
'streamlit run app.py'

# Applications will be made for a future bot
## App 1 - chatbot, uses local host to interact with the chat via web browser (streamlit).

UI: http://localhost:8501

#Future: Docker file template to container the env to an image. 
#Currently need to remove my api keys and process the env details in a different way in order to allow for apikey changes dynamically by updating the file.
